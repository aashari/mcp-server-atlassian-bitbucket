# Atlassian Bitbucket MCP Server

This project provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that acts as a bridge between AI assistants (like Anthropic's Claude, Cursor AI, or other MCP-compatible clients) and your Atlassian Bitbucket instance. It allows AI to securely access and interact with your repositories, pull requests, and workspaces in real time.

---

# Overview

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that allows AI systems to securely and contextually connect with external tools and data sources.

This server implements MCP specifically for Bitbucket Cloud, bridging your Bitbucket data with AI assistants.

## Why Use This Server?

- **Minimal Input, Maximum Output Philosophy**: Simple identifiers like `workspaceSlug` and `repoSlug` are all you need. Each tool returns comprehensive details without requiring extra flags.

- **Rich Code Visualization**: Get detailed insights into repositories and code changes with file statistics, diff views, and smart context around code modifications.

- **Secure Local Authentication**: Credentials are never stored in the server. The server runs locally, so your tokens never leave your machine and you can request only the permissions you need.

- **Intuitive Markdown Responses**: All responses use well-structured Markdown for readability with consistent formatting and navigational links.

- **Full Bitbucket Integration**: Access workspaces, repositories, pull requests, comments, code search, and more through a unified interface.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (>=18.x): [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Bitbucket Cloud Account**

---

## Step 1: Authenticate

Choose one of the following authentication methods:

### Option A: Bitbucket App Password (Recommended)

Generate one from [Bitbucket App Passwords](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/). Minimum permissions:

- Workspaces: Read
- Repositories: Read
- Pull Requests: Read

### Option B: Atlassian API Token

Generate one from [Atlassian API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).

**Note:** While the server _may_ function using an Atlassian API Token (via the standard `ATLASSIAN_*` variables) due to the shared Atlassian account system, **Bitbucket App Passwords are the strongly recommended and officially supported method** for this integration. App Passwords allow for more granular, Bitbucket-specific permission scopes, enhancing security compared to potentially broader-scoped API Tokens.

---

## Step 2: Configure Credentials

### Method A: MCP Config File (Recommended)

Create or edit `~/.mcp/configs.json`:

**Using Bitbucket App Password:**

```json
{
	"bitbucket": {
		"environments": {
			"ATLASSIAN_BITBUCKET_USERNAME": "<your_username>",
			"ATLASSIAN_BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD": "<your_app_password>"
		}
	}
}
```

**Using Atlassian API Token:**

```json
{
	"bitbucket": {
		"environments": {
			"ATLASSIAN_SITE_NAME": "bitbucket",
			"ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL": "<your_email>",
			"ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN": "<your_api_token>"
		}
	}
}
```

**Note:** For backward compatibility, the server will also recognize configurations under the full package name (`@aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket`), the unscoped package name (`mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket`), or the `atlassian-bitbucket` format if the recommended `bitbucket` key is not found. However, using the short `bitbucket` key is preferred for new configurations.

### Method B: Environment Variables

Pass credentials directly when running the server:

```bash
ATLASSIAN_BITBUCKET_USERNAME="<your_username>" \
ATLASSIAN_BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD="<your_app_password>" \
npx -y @aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket
```

---

## Step 3: Connect Your AI Assistant

Configure your MCP-compatible client to launch this server.

**Claude / Cursor Configuration:**

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"bitbucket": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket"]
		}
	}
}
```

This configuration launches the server automatically at runtime.

# Tools

This section covers the MCP tools available when using this server with an AI assistant. Note that MCP tools use `snake_case` for tool names and `camelCase` for parameters.

## `bb_ls_workspaces`

```json
{}
```

_or:_

```json
{ "query": "devteam" }
```

```json
{ "workspaceSlug": "acme-corp" }
```

> "Tell me more about the 'acme-corp' workspace."

---

## `bb_ls_repos`

```json
{ "workspaceSlug": "acme-corp", "projectKey": "PROJ" }
```

> "List repositories in 'acme-corp' for project PROJ."

---

## `bb_get_repo`

Get details of a specific repository, including owner, main branch name, comment/task counts, and recent PRs.

```json
{ "workspaceSlug": "acme-corp", "repoSlug": "backend-api" }
```

> "Show me the 'backend-api' repository in 'acme-corp'."

---

## `bb_search`

Search Bitbucket content. Scope with `scope` ('repositories', 'pullrequests', 'commits', 'code', 'all'). Code scope supports `language` and `extension` filters. The 'all' scope includes a header indicating which scope returned results.

**Code (filtered):**

```json
{
	"workspaceSlug": "acme-corp",

	"scope": "code",
	"language": "typescript"
}
```

List pull requests in a repository.

```json
{ "workspaceSlug": "acme-corp", "repoSlug": "frontend-app", "state": "OPEN" }
```

**IMPORTANT:** `targetPath` **MUST be an absolute path** (e.g., `/Users/me/projects`). The repository will be cloned into a subdirectory named after the repository slug under this directory.

```json
{
	"workspaceSlug": "acme-corp",
